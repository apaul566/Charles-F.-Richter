            <h1><strong> 
              In addition to creating the Richter Earthquake scale, Richter also wrote a few books, which these days, are widely accepted as scientific sources.

                <br/>   <h1>Seismicity of the Earth and Associated Phenomena</h1>
            </br>
              <h3><strong> 
                The first book that Richter published was Seismicity of the Earth and Associated Phenomena, which he wrote in association with Beto Gutenberg. The revised edition, published in 1954, is widely accepted these days as a standard reference in the field. This book was revolutionary since it made concepts that were usually reserved for scholars to a more accessible format.

            <br/> <h1>Elementary seismology</h1>
            </br>
              <h2><strong> This was another book that Richter published, this time in 1958. However, this book was one that was written by Richter alone. Again, this book was amazing in that it allowed the common folk to learn about concepts that in this day and age, they usually would not learn about.
